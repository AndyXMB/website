  Join us for a series of presentations focused on openHAB, including UI
  improvements, new core features and more! The details of the agenda is to be
  determined - we are looking for volunteer speakers to give presentations about
  anything that would be of interest to our general community, both developers
  and end users alike. More information on the [community
  forum](https://community.openhab.org/t/openhab-virtual-meetup-2020-and-call-for-presentations/104987).
